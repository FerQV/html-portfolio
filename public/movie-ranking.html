<hr />

<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>It is in the top due the images, the story, the soundtrack and the characters that just makes you love his movie.</p>

<h3>Mephisto</h3>
<p>I haven't watch this movie yet, but it seems really interesting. It has 4 stars, so it is fully recommended.</p>

<h3>El Laberinto del Fauno</h3>
<p>I remember when my parents play this movie on the TV and I loved it (except the part of the horse's death). Guillermo del Toro made art with this movie.</p>
